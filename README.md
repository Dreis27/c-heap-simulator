# c-heap-simulator üóÉÔ∏è

Heap memory allocation (the same as it traditionally is in C) simulator built in Java.
It employs in-memory doubly linked lists to keep track of free and used memory chunks.

This memory management structure will include a simulation of:
- **malloc**
- **free**
- **sbrk**

## Project Goals
- Simulate memory allocation (relatively close to the one present in C) using Java.
- Understand how metadata within memory blocks works.
- Implement a solid simulation and test it for edge cases

## How to run

1. navigate into the directory
2. `./build.sh`
3. `./run.sh`
  
## Overview

This memory allocator system follows the following structure:

### 1. malloc(int size)
Request a chunk of memory of desired size (in bytes). will allocate a slightly bigger size for the chunk's metadata

### 2. free(int ptr)
Free a previously allocated memory chunk by providing a pointer to the start of that memory block.
Adjacent free blocks in the same memory array will coalesce/merge. Initial memory or sbrk generated arrays will not coalesce with each other.

### 3. sbrk(int size)
Simulate "requesting" memory to the OS if the initial chunk (8192 bytes) is exceeded, creating a new array of memory of size x = smallest power of 2 larger than size.
This simulates how virtual memory could work.

### 4. print / testing
The print function will run a series of tests with respective output structure and memory display, to understand and justify decisions for the implementation. Printed on terminal you will be able to read through the different tests with their descriptions.
The given implementation isn't completely bug-free which can be observed in the last test which results in an exception.
